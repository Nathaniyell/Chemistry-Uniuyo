    desc: `Plants contain a reservoir of phytochemicals which are responsible for the treatment of several diseases including oxidative stress related diseases among others. Oxidative stress stems from an imbalance between the production and accumulation of oxidant species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates (radicals) or easily restore the resulting damage. This poses severe injury to cellular systems and threatens an organism's health, leading to many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, ageing, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Other effect due to oxidative stress damage include atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-ischemic perfusion injury, myocardial infarction, chronic inflammation, stroke and septic shock, ageing and other degenerative diseases in humans. To counter this decay, researchers have now sought antioxidants of plant origin and have reported their potential against reactive oxygen species.`,

      "EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF Luffa cylindrica (SPONGE GOURD) FRUIT FIBRE AND Zea mays (MAIZE) HUSK AS POTENTIAL BIOPLASTICS RAW MATERIALS",
    unit: "environmental",
    author: "Roland Nzan OGAR",

    desc: `There has been an increase in the requirements for plastics because of its cost effectiveness, lighter weight compared to other materials such as metals and ceramics, waterproof nature, and strength. In addition to these advantages, plastics exhibit disadvantages of difficulty in rapid decomposition and non-renewability, possibly leading to environmental pollution. A general solution to solve this issue involves the use of biodegradable polymers as the main ingredient in preparing plastics; Cellulose can be the main choice as raw materials for making bioplastics because the source of cellulose can be obtained from waste so that it can also be a solution to overcome environmental problems.`,
