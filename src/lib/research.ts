    desc: `Plants contain a reservoir of phytochemicals which are responsible for the treatment of several diseases including oxidative stress related diseases among others. Oxidative stress stems from an imbalance between the production and accumulation of oxidant species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates (radicals) or easily restore the resulting damage. This poses severe injury to cellular systems and threatens an organism's health, leading to many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, ageing, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Other effect due to oxidative stress damage include atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, post-ischemic perfusion injury, myocardial infarction, chronic inflammation, stroke and septic shock, ageing and other degenerative diseases in humans. To counter this decay, researchers have now sought antioxidants of plant origin and have reported their potential against reactive oxygen species.`,

      "EVALUATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF Luffa cylindrica (SPONGE GOURD) FRUIT FIBRE AND Zea mays (MAIZE) HUSK AS POTENTIAL BIOPLASTICS RAW MATERIALS",
    unit: "environmental",
    author: "Roland Nzan OGAR",
    published_at: "JULY 2023",
    desc: `There has been an increase in the requirements for plastics because of its cost effectiveness, lighter weight compared to other materials such as metals and ceramics, waterproof nature, and strength. In addition to these advantages, plastics exhibit disadvantages of difficulty in rapid decomposition and non-renewability, possibly leading to environmental pollution. A general solution to solve this issue involves the use of biodegradable polymers as the main ingredient in preparing plastics; Cellulose can be the main choice as raw materials for making bioplastics because the source of cellulose can be obtained from waste so that it can also be a solution to overcome environmental problems.`,

      "TRIPARTITE MAGNETIC MONTMORILLONITE NANOCOMPOSITE FOR REMOVAL OF BISPHENOL A, NICKEL, CADMIUM AND LEAD IONS FROM INDUSTRIAL EFFLUENTS",
    unit: "environmental",
    author: "Okon Edem OKON",
    published_at: "JULY 2023",
    desc: `The removal of Bisphenol A. Ni, Cd and Pb ions onto unmodified montmorillonite (MM), doped titanium nanocomposite (DTC) and tripartite magnetic montmorillonite nanocomposite (TMC) was investigated. The nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ reduction with iron salts followed by chemical impregnation by Sol-Gel method and subsequently coupled by chemical precipitation to form the TMC. Relevant spectroscopic methods were also employed for characterization. The modified clays showed magnetic properties with FTIR result, revealing new reflections at 1990 cm for NCS (isocyanate). Similarly, the tripartite magnetic nanocomposite had new reflections at 1032 cm' for cyanide (-OCN), 1625 cm" for open chain azo (-N-N-), and 2050 cm" for transition metal carbonyl (-M-CO-). XRD analysis revealed interlayer spacing (1.67-1.71 nm). BET surface area were respectively 90.39, 210.72 and 288.08 m2/g and adsorption capacities of 81.48, 82.27 and 91.05% for MM, DTC and TMC. The tripartite magnetic composite also had higher adsorption and photodegradation capacity (96.21%) towards the organic pollutant compared to unmodified clay (22.99% ). Adsorption data were best fitted with Freundlich isotherm model revealing multilayer coverage as predominant mechanism of adsorption. Kinetic mechanism was predominantly pseudo-second-order, revealing chemisorption process. The thermodynamic studies confirmed that the process of adsorption was exothermic and spontaneous with negative standard enthalpy and Gibb's free energy (-58.21 kJ/mol) at 30Â°C. Similar trends were observed for metal ions adsorption. Modification imparted cationic and aromatic moiety onto the montmorillonite thus increasing pollutant-adsorbent interactions and enhanced adsorption of BPA and metal ions in a simulated industrial effluent. In a continuous plug flow column, the tripartite magnetic composite demonstrated longer breakthrough and exhaustion time (19, 45 hours respectively), compared to the conventional adsorbents (2, 21 and 5, 29 hours respectively) for BPA adsorption from simulated effluent. Similar trend was also observed for real effluent. Adams-Bohart isotherm showed highest adsorption capacity of 120.28 mg/g for simulated effluent and 29.60 mg/g for real effluent. In both real and simulated effluents, bed volume was highest with TMC and revealed that the prepared tripartite nanocomposite is an efficient alternative adsorbent and can compete with commercially available adsorbents.`,
