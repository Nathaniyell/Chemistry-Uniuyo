        The Department of Chemistry started as the Department of Pure and
        Applied Chemistry in 1983 in the then University of Cross River State,
        Uyo. It grew up into the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. In
        2001, Biochemistry programme was demerged from the department and
        elevated to a substantive department, which formed the nucleus of the
        faculty of Basic Medical Sciences of the University of Uyo. Hitherto,
        the Department had been offering courses leading to B.Sc. degree in Pure
        and Applied Chemistry until Senate of the University of Uyo abolished
        the dual programmes in 2002.The department now teaches courses leading
        to the award of the Bachelor (B.Sc) of Science/Postgraduate (MSc. and
        Ph.D) degree in Chemistry. On August 14, 2013 the Department re-located
        from the Town Campus of the University to her present location in the
        Faculty of Science Building, Permanent campus, Use Offot.Currently the
        department has six (6) units, namely; Analytical Chemistry,
        Environmental Chemistry, Industrial/Polymer Chemistry, Inorganic
        Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Physical Chemistry units.As a central
        course to all other science disciplines and technology, the degree
        programme in Chemistry is designed to foster in undergraduates and
        postgraduates an appreciation of this centrality of chemistry to human
        well-being, as well as its linkage to, and interactions with other
        science disciplines and the industry.Our degree programme also
        stimulates the development of a broad range of skills applied in
        chemical and non-chemical areas, and this provides confidence for
        employment and entrepreneurship.
